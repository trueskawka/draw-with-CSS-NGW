### Tools

For this workshop you'll need:

1. A browser 

    Preferably Chrome or Firefox, but maybe we'll find fun edge 
    cases in Edge or Safari.

2. An editor and/or an interactive environment 

    You can use any code editor or CSS environment you want. I usually 
    draw with CSS in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [Dabblet](http://dabblet.com/).
